# pipelineci-app

GitHub App is a type of integration provide by GitHub that allows us to extend
GitHub's functionality.

This repo contains one such app. The app's public page is located at (pipelineci2024)[https://github.com/apps/pipelineci2024].

## Running locally

### Create and run smee server

Since this repo's code will be running locally, we will need to provide a way for github
to access the app's endpoints. Setting up a `smee` webproxy server is the simplest way to forward
requests from GitHub app to locally running service. Utilities such as `ngrok` or `localtunnel` will
work fine too.
